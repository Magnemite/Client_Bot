These are the public part of PokeWorldBW's scripts for his client bot.

The Messages are messages the bots can respond with when someone only says their name and nothing after.                
The Welcome Messages will be sent when someone joins #The Dock

"{{user}}" in a messages will be replaced with the name of the person saying the bot's name.                            
"{{USER}}" will have the player's name in all uppercase. (doesn't work for Welcome Messages)

Make sure to add a new line when adding new messages!
